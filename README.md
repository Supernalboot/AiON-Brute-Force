# AiON-Brute-Force
A quick script I wrote to interact with the Bungie ARG AiON Database.

# How to use
in this repo you will find 3 files: `AiON Manual.py`, `AiONBF.py` and `AiONdatabase.json`.

`AiON Manual.py` will allow you to manually input a value, and that value will be stored in `AiONdatabase.json`.

`AiONBF.py` is your main file, this will Brute force the input over time and slowly update `AiONdatabase.json`.

You will have 2 options to select from Single Thread and Multi Thread.

Multi thread is highly experimental! Like to the point I havent touched it, 99.9% of users will be fine with Single Thread.

### ==I DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU SET THE DELAY TO ANYTHING BELOW FOUR SECONDS!!!!==
you will probably get rate limited hard.

And thats it, you're basically good to go.
